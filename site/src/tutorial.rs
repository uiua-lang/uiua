        <h1>"Introduction"</h1>
        <p>"Welcome to the "{lang}" tutorial! Each page of this tutorial will introduce you to a new concept in the language. The tutorial is designed to be read in order, but you can jump around if you want."</p>
        <p>{lang}" is an array programming language in the same family as APL, J, and BQN. "{lang}" focuses particularly on tacit programming, that is, writing code without naming variables. It does this by putting all values on a global stack."</p>

        <Hd id="what-is-array-programming">"What is Array Programming?"</Hd>
        <p>"Before jumping into "{lang}", it may be helpful to understand the paradigm of which it is a part."</p>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_programming">"Array Programming"</a>" is a way of writing programs first developed by Ken Iverson in the 1960s. It emphasizes the use of arrays as the primary data structure, and many operations work on entire arrays at once. An array language also has a rich set of operations for manipulating arrays in various ways, to the point where many data structures and control flow constructs are replaced with operations on arrays."</p>

        <Hd id="why-array-programming">"Why Array Programming?"</Hd>
        <p>"There are many reasons that Array Programming is cool, but here are a few:"</p>
        <p>"Perhaps the most practical reason is that arrays as a data structure are what some refer to as \"machine-sympathetic\". Because array elements exist in contiguous memory, they can be processed very quickly by modern CPUs. Many operations can be "<em>"vectorized"</em>", meaning that the CPU can apply the operation to many elements in parallel. In addition, allocating memory for a large array can be done all at once. Although most array languages are dynamic and interpreted, they can often compete in performance with compiled, static languages, at least for certain kinds of tasks."</p>
        <p>"Array programming can change the way you think about programs. All operations you use act on a single, unified data structure. You stop thinking about individual items and start thinking about entire collections and how they can interact and transform."</p>
        <p>"Finally, many common algorithms are built-in to array languages, and are often written with a single glyph. This makes array code very concise and expressive. Several lines of code in a language like C or Python can often be just a few characters in an array language. Array languages do away with much of the "<em>"ceremony"</em>" that is present in other languages, so you can focus more on the problem you are trying to solve."</p>

        <Hd id="why-uiua">"Why "{lang}"?"</Hd>
        <p>{lang}" retains many of the array operations and semantics of its predecessor array languages. However, while APL, J, and BQN structure code with syntax and semantics based on mathematical notation:"</p>
        <p><code>"1 + 2"</code>", "<code>"4×ω-2"</code>", etc."</p>
        <p>{lang}" puts values on a stack, and operators appear to the left of their arguments:"</p>
        <p>""<code>"+ 1 2"</code>", "<code>"×4-2"</code>", etc."</p>
        <p>"This allows "{lang}" to be, in most cases, even more terse than other array languages. That being said, "{lang}" has been designed to remain readable as much as possible, even without named local variables. While writing tacit code can quickly become unwieldy in other array languages, "{lang}" embraces tacitness as the only way."</p>
        <p>{lang}" also features built-in functionality for working with images, audio, and GIFs, so once you learn the language, you can very quickly get started writing programs that do interesting things!"</p>
        <p>"Note that "{lang}" is not yet stable. While most of the core features are unlikely to change much, more complex ones are still in flux. This tutorial is based on the current state of the language, and it is updated as the language changes."</p>
        <p><strong>"Important Note"</strong>": This website usually uses the most recent development version of "{lang}", rather than the stable release. This is so people can test new features easily. Some features available here may not be available if you install "{lang}" locally in the default way. The version of "{lang}" currently running on this site is "<code>{uiua::VERSION}</code>"."</p>

        <Hd id="who">"Who is this tutorial for?"</Hd>
        <p>"This tutorial is targeted at people who have at least a little bit of experience with programming. While you don't need to be proficient in any particular language, it will be helpful to understand concepts like variables and functions. However, even if you are a beginner, you can likely find your way through by taking the time to understand each example."</p>

        <Hd id="the-stack">"The Stack"</Hd>
        <p>"In "{lang}", all operations operate on a global stack. Lines of code are evaluated from "<A href="/docs/rtl">"right to left"</A>", top to bottom."</p>
        <p>"A number simply pushes its value onto the stack."</p>
        <Editor example="5"/>
        <Editor example="1 2 3"/>
        <p>"Operators pop values off the stack and push their results."</p>
        <p>"For example, "<Prim prim=Primitive::Add glyph_only=true/>" pops two values off the stack and pushes their sum."</p>
        <Editor example="+ 1 2"/>
        <p><Prim prim=Primitive::Mul glyph_only=true/>", of course, multiplies the two values instead."</p>
        <Editor example="+ 1 × 2 3" help={&["", "Try the arrows to see how the stack changes with each operation."]}/>
        <p>"In the editor, items that end up on the "<em>"top"</em>" of the stack are shown at the "<em>"bottom"</em>" of the output. This is so that consecutive lines of code show their outputs in the correct order."</p>
        <Editor example="5\n+1 2\n\"Hello, World!\"\n+1 @a"/>
        <p>"This orientation can be changed in the editor's settings. Click the ⚙️ icon in the top right corner of the editor to see them."</p>
        <p>"Operations can span multiple lines. Every line uses the same stack!"</p>
        <Editor example="1 2\n+\n5\n×"/>

        <Hd id="comments">"Comments"</Hd>
        <p>"Comments are denoted with "<code>"#"</code>" and run to the end of the line."</p>

        <p>{lang}" does not have multiline comments."</p>

        <Hd id="formatting">"Formatting"</Hd>
        <p>"Most "{lang}" built-in functions use special Unicode characters. To type multiplication and division signs, you can use "<code>"*"</code>" and "<code>"%"</code>" respectively. Then, run the code to format the ASCII characters into Unicode."</p>
        <Editor example="# Click Run to format!\n%6 *3 8" help={&["", "⇡⇡⇡⇡ Click   "]}/>
        <p>"Most built-in functions have names you can type rather than symbols. Formatting works on these too. "<em><strong>"This is the primary way of entering "{lang}"'s glyphs."</strong></em></p>
        <p>"Try formatting the lines below by clicking "<strong>"Run"</strong>"."</p>
        <Editor example="max sqrt 10 mod 10 pow 2 8"/>
        <Editor example="abs +`1 `2"/>
        <p>"You don't have to type the whole name, just enough to disambiguate it from others."</p>
        <Editor example="cei 1.5\nceil 1.5\nceili 1.5\nceilin 1.5\nceiling 1.5"/>
        <p>"You don't even have to remove spaces between built-in function names. The formatter will figure it out!"</p>
        <Editor example="roundsqrtpi"/>
        <p>"On this site, you can also click the ↧ symbol on any editor to show a palette of all the "{lang}" glyphs. You can then click on any glyph to insert it into the editor."</p>
        <p>"Here is a table of all the glyphs that are typed with ASCII characters that get converted to glyphs."</p>
        <table class="left-header-table">
            <tr>
                <th>"Name"</th>

            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>"As noted in the table, negative number literals are typed with the "<code>"`"</code>" character. This is because "<code>"-"</code>" is used for subtraction."</p>
        <Editor example="+ `1 `2"/>
        <p>"The formatter will align consecutive end-of-line comments. Try it out!"</p>
        <Editor example="%2 8 # Line\n@x # these\n1 # up"/>

        <h3>"Output Comments"</h3>
        <p>"A comment that starts with additional "<code>"#"</code>"s is an "<em>"output comment"</em>". The formatter replaces the text of an output comment with as many values from the stack as there are extra "<code>"#"</code>"s."</p>
        <p>"Click Run to try it out!"</p>

        <Hd id="stack-functions">"Stack Functions"</Hd>
        <p>"There are a few functions that work on the stack itself. Some of these are critical and can be found scattered across all "{lang}" code."</p>
        <Hd id="dup"><Prim prim=Dup/></Hd>
        <p><Prim prim=Dup/>" duplicates the top item on the stack."</p>
        <p>"In general, functions do not leave their arguments on the stack. If you want to reuse a value, the most basic way is to "<Prim prim=Dup/>" it first."</p>
        <p>"For example, if you wanted to square a number, you could "<Prim prim=Dup/>" it, then "<Prim prim=Mul/>"."</p>
        <Editor example="×.4"/>
        <p><Prim prim=Dup/>" is often used in the examples on this site to show both the input and output of a function."</p>
        <Editor example="√.144"/>
        <br/>
        <Hd id="flip"><Prim prim=Flip/></Hd>
        <p><Prim prim=Flip/>" swaps the top two items on the stack."</p>
        <p>"This is useful when you want to call a function that takes two arguments, but the arguments are on the stack in the wrong order."</p>
        <p>"For example, if you wanted to get the reciprocal of a number, you would "<Prim prim=Div/>" "<code>"1"</code>" by it. But, if the number is already on the stack, you would need to use "<Prim prim=Flip/>"."</p>
        <Editor example="÷1 5"/>
        <Editor example="÷:1 5"/>
        <Editor example=":1 2 3 4 5"/>
        <br/>
        <Hd id="pop"><Prim prim=Pop/></Hd>
        <p><Prim prim=Pop/>" removes the top item from the stack."</p>
        <p>"This is useful when you want to discard a value that you do not need."</p>
        <Editor example="1 pop 2 3 4 ◌ 5 6"/>
        <Hd id="stack"><Prim prim=Stack/></Hd>
        <p><Prim prim=Stack/>" prints the entire stack."</p>
        <p>"It also attaches line and column numbers."</p>
        <p>"This is useful for debugging by inspecting the stack."</p>
        <Editor example="√+ ? .+ ? 1 ×3 4"/>
        <p><Prim prim=Stack/>" is compatible with a language feature called "<em>"subscripts"</em>". If you add a little subscript number to the right of it, it will only print that many values from the stack."</p>
        <p>"We'll talk more about subscripts later. For now, know that you can add subscripts to "<Prim prim=Stack/>" by adding consecutive "<code>"?"</code>"s. The formatter will convert it for you!"</p>
        <Editor example="+1 ?? × ??? 4 ?? ×. -3 5 # Try formatting!"/>

        <Hd id="challenges">"Challenges"</Hd>
        <p>"At the end of most sections of this tutorial, there will be a few challenges to test your understanding."</p>
        <p>"The code you write will be run on multiple inputs and tested for correctness."</p>
        <p>"Each challenge has an example input and output followed by some test cases. There is also a hidden test case that your code is checked against, so make sure to think about edge cases!"</p>

        <h1>"Arrays"</h1>
        <p>{lang}" is, first and foremost, an array language. The only composite data type is the multidimensional array. Arrays have a lot of nice properties, and the language's built-in functions are designed to make it easy to work with them. If you've only ever programmed in non-array languages, then this will be a completely foreign paradigm. In most array languages, most data structures and control flow are replaced with operations on arrays."</p>

        <Hd id="creating-arrays">"Creating Arrays"</Hd>
        <p>"Other than with functions, "{lang}" has two ways to create arrays. They are called "<em>"strand notation"</em>" and "<em>"stack notation"</em>"."</p>
        <p><strong>"Strand notation"</strong>" uses underscores to connect elements."</p>
        <Editor example="1_2_3"/>
        <Editor example="\"Hello\"_\"World\""/>
        <p>"Strand notation is good when you want to create short and/or simple arrays. For longer or more complex arrays, you can use stack notation."</p>
        <p><strong>"Stack notation"</strong>" uses "<code>"[]"</code>" brackets to group elements."</p>
        <Editor example="[1 2 3]"/>
        <Editor example="[¯5 37 42 π]"/>
        <p>"What's cool about stack notation is that it is "<em>"not"</em>" just a way to list elements. The code between the brackets runs from right to left as it normally would. When it is done, any items on the stack higher than when it started are put into the array. This gives you some cool ways to create arrays."</p>
        <p>"Remember that "<Prim prim=Dup/>" duplicates the top item on the stack."</p>
        <Editor example="[...5]"/>
        <Editor example="[×2.×2.×2.×2 .2]"/>
        <Editor example="[+1 2 +3 4]"/>
        <p>"Any functions inside the brackets will \"pull in\" their arguments from outside if there are not enough inside."</p>
        <Editor example="[+] 1 9"/>
        <Editor example="[...] 7"/>
        <Editor example="[+×2] 20 2"/>
        <p>"You can also use stack notation to make multidimensional arrays."</p>
        <Editor example="[1_2_3 4_5_6]"/>
        <Editor example="[...[1 2 3]]"/>
        <p>"Unlike strand notation, stack notation may span multiple lines. The lines are still executed right-to-left, but they are executed bottom-to-top so that the arrays come out the same way they look in the code."</p>
        <Editor example="\
[1 2 3
 4 5 6
 7 8 9]"/>
        <Editor example="\
[[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]

        <Hd id="shape-len"><Prim prim=Shape/>" and "<Prim prim=Len/></Hd>
        <p>"Other than their data, arrays also have a property called their "<strong>"shape"</strong>". Shape is a list of non-negative integers that describes the array's size along each of its axes."</p>
        <p>"We can get the array's shape with the "<Prim prim=Shape/>" function. It's a triangle because a triangle is a shape."</p>
        <Editor example="△[1 2 3]"/>
        <Editor example="△5"/>
        <Editor example="△[[1 2 3] [4 5 6]]"/>
        <Editor example="△[...[1 2 3]]"/>
        <p>"Arrays with 0 dimensions (an empty "<Prim prim=Shape/>") are called "<strong>"scalars"</strong>"."</p>
        <p>"Arrays with 1 dimension are often called "<strong>"lists"</strong>" or "<strong>"vectors"</strong>"."</p>
        <p>"Arrays with 2 dimensions are often called "<strong>"tables"</strong>" or "<strong>"matrices"</strong>"."</p>
        <p>"While there are not common names for arrays with 3 or more dimensions, "{lang}" supports arrays with an arbitrary number of axes."</p>
        <p>"The first element of the shape is the number of "<em>"rows"</em>" of the array. "<em>"Rows"</em>" does not refer just to the rows of a matrix or table. It is the groups of elements along the leading axis of the array. For lists, this is just the individual elements. For matrices, it is the rows as you might traditionally think of them. But arrays with a higher number of dimensions have rows as well. For example, in an array with 3 dimensions, each row is a matrix."</p>
        <p>"From shape we can derive two closely-related properties called "<strong>"length"</strong>" and "<strong>"rank"</strong>"."</p>
        <p><Prim prim=Len/>" is the number of rows in the array. Length is always equal to the first number in the shape (or 1 if the shape is empty)."</p>
        <p><strong>"Rank"</strong>" is the number of dimensions of the array. It is equivalent to the "<Prim prim=Len/>" of the "<Prim prim=Shape/>"."</p>
        <Editor example=" △[1_2_3 4_5_6 7_8_9]\n ⧻[1_2_3 4_5_6 7_8_9]\n⧻△[1_2_3 4_5_6 7_8_9] # Rank"/>

        <p>"To understand how the pretty-printed output corresponds to the actual array, we can use "<Prim prim=Reshape/>" to create a multidimensional array. "<Prim prim=Reshape/>" uses its first argument as a new shape for its second argument."</p>
        <p>"Here, we create a "<Prim prim=Range/>" array of all the numbers up to "<code>"24"</code>" and turn it into a 3-dimensional array with the shape "<code>"[2 3 4]"</code>"."</p>
        <Editor example="↯2_3_4 ⇡24"/>
        <p>"Notice there are "<code>"2"</code>" big cells, each with "<code>"3"</code>" rows of "<code>"4"</code>" elements."</p>
        <p>"This expands to any number of dimensions. The more dimensions, the more space between the cells representing earlier axes."</p>

        <Hd id="pervasion">"Pervasion"</Hd>

        <Editor example="+1_2_3 4_5_6"/>
        <p>"When doing a pervasive operation on two arrays, the shape of one array must be the "<em>"prefix"</em>" of the shape of the other."</p>
        <Editor example="+[1 2] [3 4 5]"/> // Should fail

        <p>"If you want to do some pervasive operation on arrays whose shapes do not match, you can set a default value with "<Prim prim=Fill/>". Any places where the shapes don't match will be filled in with that value."</p>
        <Editor example="⬚10+ [1 2] [3 4 5 6 7]"/>
        <p><Prim prim=Fill/>" can be used in a lot of other cases. See its documentation for more."</p>

        <p>"For example, "<Prim prim=Reduce/>" applies a function \"between\" all rows of an array."</p>
        <p><Prims prims={[Reduce, Add]}/>" is therefore the sum of all the rows of an array."</p>

        <p><Prim prim=Scan/>" is similar, but it returns all the intermediate results."</p>
        <Editor example="\\+ 1_2_3_4"/>
        <p><Prim prim=Rows/>" applies a function to each row of an array."</p>
        <p>"For example, "<Prims prims=[Reduce, Add]/>" adds each row of a matrix to the next, effectively summing along the columns."</p>
        <p><Prims prims=[Rows, Reduce, Add]/>" sums each row itself."</p>
        <Editor example="    [1_2_3 4_5_6 7_8_9]\n /+ [1_2_3 4_5_6 7_8_9]\n≡/+ [1_2_3 4_5_6 7_8_9]"/>
        <p><Prim prim=Table/>" applies a function between all combinations of rows of two arrays. This is sometimes called the "<em>"outer product"</em>"."</p>
        <Editor example="⊞+ [5 6 7 8] [10 20 30 40]"/>
        <p>"In the same way that \"monadic\" and \"dyadic\" functions refer to functions that take one or two array arguments respectively, \"monadic\" and \"dyadic\" "<em>"modifiers"</em>" refer to modifiers that take one or two "<em>"functions"</em>" respectively."</p>

        <p>"In addition to creating a new function with a capitalized binding name, as discussed in the "<A href="/tutorial/bindings">"previous section"</A>", functions in "{lang}" can also be created by surrounding code with "<code>"()"</code>"s."</p>
        <p>"This is usually only necessary when you need to call multiple functions within a modifier."</p>

        <Hd id="local-bindings">"A Note on Local Bindings"</Hd>
        <p>"Bindings in "{lang}" can "<em>"only"</em>" be global. There is no way to give a name to a value within an inline function. A "<code>"←"</code>" inside "<code>"()"</code>"s is a syntax error."</p>
        <p>"This is a deliberate design decision. It forces you to write tacit code, a.k.a. code with functions that do not mention their arguments. "{lang}" is designed to make writing tacit code as workable as possible. "<em>"How"</em>" it does this will be discussed in "<A href="/tutorial/morestack">"later"</A>" "<A href="/tutorial/advancedarray">"sections"</A>"."</p>

        <Hd id="format-strings">"Format Strings"</Hd>

        <p><code>"_"</code>"s still need to be escaped in raw format strings."</p>
        <Editor example="1 2 3\n$$ _\\__\\__"/>
        <p>"Because format strings are just functions, you can use them with modifiers like "<Prim prim=Reduce/>". This is a common way to join a list of "<Prim prim=Box/>"ed strings."</p>

        <p>"The "<A href="/tutorial/strings">"Working with Strings"</A>" tutorial has a "<A href="/tutorial/strings#format-string-tricks">"section"</A>" with more format string tricks."</p>

        <Hd id="stack-signatures">"Stack Signatures"</Hd>
        <p>"Bindings and inline functions can have a "<em>"stack signature"</em>" declared with a "<code>"|"</code>" followed by 1 or 2 numbers separated by a "<code>"."</code>". The first number is the number of arguments the function pops from the stack. The second number is the number of values the function pushes to the stack."</p>
        <p>"The second number is optional. If it is not given, it is assumed to be 1."</p>
        <p>"In bindings, the "<code>"|"</code>" comes after the "<code>"←"</code>". In inline functions, it comes after the "<code>"("</code>"."</p>

        <Editor example="≡(|2.1 ⊟.×) 1_2_3 4_5_6"/>
        <p>"Stack signatures are useful for documenting functions to make sure that they are used correctly."</p>
        <p>"A signature declaration is "<em>"required"</em>" if the function's signature cannot be inferred. The compiler can usually infer a function's signature unless you are doing something weird that it cannot reason about."</p>
        <p>"A declared signature always overrides the inferred signature. However, if they do not match, a warning will be emitted."</p>
        <Editor example="F ← |3.2 ⊟+1\nF 1 4"/> // Should fail
        <p>"In that example, the net stack change of the declared signature of "<code>"|3.2"</code>" is actually the same of that of the inferred signature of "<code>"|2.1"</code>". Either way, the function will cause the stack to have one less value."</p>
        <p>"If this is "<em>"not"</em>" the case, the declared signature will be "<em>"made"</em>" to be correct by, after the function has run, either popping extra arguments or pushing extra outputs below on the stack."</p>
        <p>"For example, even though this function has signature "<code>"|2.1"</code>", the declared signature of "<code>"|2.2"</code>" causes an extra debug output to be pushed. This debug output is a boxed string. This is done to ensure that the function does in fact have 2 outputs."</p>
        <Editor example="F ← |2.2 ⊟+1\nF 1 4 5"/> // Should fail
        <p>"Conversely, if the function needs to have more "<em>"arguments"</em>", such as here where we declare it to have signature "<code>"|4.2"</code>", some extra arguments will be popped from the stack. In this case, it is the "<code>"6"</code>" that is popped. We can see that this does in fact make the function turn 4 values on the stack into 2."</p>
        <Editor example="F ← |4.2 ⊟+1\nF 1 4 5 6"/> // Should fail
        <p><strong>"The point of allowing this is that functions which are only partially written can still be run and debugged. But finished code should never have warnings!"</strong></p>
        <p>"If the compiler cannot derive the stack signature of a function and you give it one which is "<em>"wrong"</em>", the function will throw an error at runtime."</p>

        <Editor example="÷:⇡. 5"/> // Should fail
        <p>"This solution works, but as the style diagnostic suggests, it is not quite idiomatic."</p>
        <p>"When the first function you call is dyadic, it can get a little trickier. For example, if you wanted to get all the integers between two numbers, you may try the following:"</p>
        <Editor example="+⊃∘(⇡-) 3 8"/> // Should fail
        <p>"Again, as the style diagnostic tells you, there is a better way."</p>
        <p>"The "<Prim prim=On/>" modifier calls a function but keeps its first argument on top of the stack. This can be used in both of the above examples."</p>
        <Editor example="÷⟜⇡ 5"/>

        <p>"Having a single glyph for something that can be written as simply "<Prims prims=[Fork, Identity]/>" may seem unnecessary, but you'll find that because the pattern is so common, it makes code easier to both read and write."</p>
        <p>"The "<Prim prim=By/>" modifier is similar. Instead of keeping the first argument on top of the stack, it keeps the last argument below the function's outputs."</p>

        <p>{lang}", and array languages in general, require much less control flow than other programming languages. Most operations that would be loops in other languages are simply operations on arrays. Because boolean operations return numbers, a lot of checks that would be done with "<code>"if"</code>" statements in other languages become mathematical or indexing operations in array languages."</p>

        else:
            odd.append(i)
    return even, odd

splitArray([1, 2, 3, 7, 2, 4, 5])"</code>

        <h1>"Thinking with Arrays"</h1>
        <p>"So far, we've covered the mechanics of working with arrays in "{lang}". However, if you are new to the array paradigm, it may not be clear how to use arrays to solve problems."</p>
        <p>"This section covers some of the common functions and modifiers that pop up when solving many different problems."</p>

        <Hd id="masks-and-keep">"Masks and "<Prim prim=Keep/></Hd>
        <p>"Many languages have some sort of "<code>"filter"</code>" function that takes a predicate and a list and returns a list of all the elements that satisfy the predicate. In array languages, we take a different approach."</p>
        <p>"First, we create a "<em>"mask"</em>" array. A mask array is an array of "<code>"0"</code>"s and "<code>"1"</code>"s where "<code>"1"</code>"s represent the rows that satisfy the predicate. For pervasive functions, this is extremely simple."</p>
        <p>"For example, if we wanted to create a mask of all numbers greater that 4, we simply treat the whole array as a single unit."</p>
        <Editor example=">4. [2 8 3 9 1 7 2]"/>
        <p>"The "<Prim prim=Keep/>" function takes a mask array and an array and returns an array of all the rows that have a "<code>"1"</code>" in the mask. This is essentially a filter."</p>
        <Editor example="▽ >4. [2 8 3 9 1 7 2]"/>
        <p><Prim prim=Keep/>" also works with "<Prim prim=Under/>" so that you can modify the rows that have a "<code>"1"</code>" in the mask."</p>
        <Editor example="⍜▽(×10) >4. [2 8 3 9 1 7 2]"/>
        <p><Prim prim=Keep/>" has a few other use cases with non-masks. See its documentation for more."</p>

        <Hd id="where"><Prim prim=Where/></Hd>
        <p>"The "<Prim prim=Where/>" function converts a mask array into an array of indices where the mask is "<code>"1"</code>"."</p>
        <Editor example="⊚. >4. [2 8 3 9 1 7 2]"/>
        <p>"This works with multi-dimensional arrays as well."</p>
        <Editor example="⊚. >4. [2_8_3 9_1_7]"/>
        <p><Prim prim=Un/><Prim prim=Where/>" converts an array of indices into a mask array."</p>
        <Editor example="°⊚ [3 9 5 8]"/>
        <Editor example="°⊚ [1_2 3_4]"/>
        <p><Prim prim=Select/><Prim prim=Where/>" is equivalent to "<Prim prim=Keep/>" (at least for boolean predicates)."</p>
        <Editor example="⊏⊚ =0◿2. [2 8 3 9 1 7 2]"/>
        <Editor example="▽  =0◿2. [2 8 3 9 1 7 2]"/>

        <Hd id="scan"><Prim prim=Scan/></Hd>
        <p>"The "<Prim prim=Scan/>" modifier is similar to "<Prim prim=Reduce/>", but it returns an array of all the intermediate results."</p>
        <Editor example="/+ [1 2 3 4]\n\\+ [1 2 3 4]"/>
        <p>"This can be useful when used on a mask."</p>
        <p>"For example, if we wanted to get the first word of a string, we could start by creating a mask of all the non-space characters."</p>
        <p>"Then we can use "<Prim prim=Scan/><Prim prim=Mul/>" to zero the mask after the first word."</p>
        <p>"Finally, we can use "<Prim prim=Keep/>" to apply the mask and get the first word."</p>
        <p>"Use the arrows to see how the mask changes."</p>
        <Editor example=r#"▽ \× ≠@ . "What's the first word?""#/>

        <Hd id="fill"><Prim prim=Fill/></Hd>
        <p>"Recall that the "<Prim prim=Fill/>" modifier sets a \"fill value\" that can be used by certain functions."</p>
        <p>"One common use is to set a default value that will be used when the shapes of arrays do not match."</p>
        <Editor example="⬚0+ 10_20 3_4_5_6"/>
        <p>"For example, if you wanted to logical OR two masks with different shapes, you could use "<Prim prim=Fill/>" with a different fill value depending on what you want to do with the mismatched parts."</p>
        <Editor example="⬚0↥ 1_0_0_1_0 0_1_0\n⬚1↥ 1_0_0_1_0 0_1_0"/>
        <p>"Another interesting use is a "<Prim prim=Fill/>"ed "<Prim prim=Rotate/>". Instead of wrapping values around, it fills in one side of the array with the fill value."</p>
        <Editor example="  ↻¯2 [1 2 3 4 5]\n⬚0↻¯2 [1 2 3 4 5]"/>

        <Hd id="partition"><Prim prim=Partition/></Hd>
        <p><Prim prim=Partition/>" is a powerful modifier that splits up an array based on a list of consecutive keys. Before explaining it further, let's look at a simple example of a very common use case: splitting a string into words."</p>
        <Editor example=r#"⊜□ ≠@ . "Look at that!""#/>
        <p>"First, we create a mask of all the non-space characters. Then, "<Prim prim=Partition/>" calls "<Prim prim=Box/>" on each section of the string that corresponds to a run of "<code>"1"</code>"s in the mask."</p>
        <p>"Here is another example using "<Prim prim=Partition/><Prim prim=Box/>" with the inputs explicitly defined."</p>
        <Editor example="[1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8]\n[1 1 0 5 6 6 0 1]\n⊜□"/>
        <p>"Notice that "<code>"0"</code>"s in the keys array cause the corresponding sections of the input array to be skipped, so "<code>"3"</code>" and "<code>"7"</code>" are omitted from the output."</p>
        <p>"We use "<Prim prim=Box/>" here because the resulting sections have different lengths. If we expect the sections to have the same lengths, we can use "<Prim prim=Identity/>" instead."</p>
        <Editor example="[1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8]\n[1 1 2 2 0 0 3 3]\n⊜∘"/>
        <p><Prim prim=Partition/>" is very useful when working with strings. See the "<A href="/tutorial/strings">"Strings tutorial"</A>" for more."</p>
        <p>"A hint for one of the challenges below: "<Prim prim=Partition/>" works with "<Prim prim=Under/>"!"</p>

        <h1>"Modules"</h1>
        <p>"Modules are a way to organize your code in "{lang}". They can either be defined in a scope, or imported from a file. Any "{lang}" file can be used as a module."</p>
        <p>"Modules can be compared to namespaces in other languages."</p>

        <Hd id="scoped-modules">"Scoped Modules"</Hd>
        <p>"Scoped modules are defined between a "<code>"┌─╴"</code>" and a "<code>"└─╴"</code>"."</p>
        <p>"Both delimiters format from "<code>"---"</code>"."</p>
        <p>" The "<code>"┌─╴"</code>" should be immediately followed by a name for the module. Module names follow the same rules as other bindings."</p>
        <p>"Names from inside the module can be referenced by following the module name with a "<code>"~"</code>"."</p>
        <Editor example="---Mod\n  A ← 5\n  F ← +1\n  G ← F F\n---\nMod~G Mod~A" help={&["", "Try formatting!"]}/>
        <p>"Bindings defined inside a scoped module are only visible inside the module."</p>
        <Editor example="┌─╴Mod\n  A ← 5\n  F ← +1\n  G ← F F\n└─╴\nG A"/> // Should fail
        <p>"Names from inside the module can be "<em>"made"</em>" visible by following the module name with a "<code>"~"</code>" and a list of the names to make visible."</p>
        <Editor example="┌─╴Mod ~ A G\n  A ← 5\n  F ← +1\n  G ← F F\n└─╴\nG A"/>
        <p>"Note that these names are brought into the module's parent scope as private bindings, so they cannot be referenced from outside the parent."</p>
        <Editor example="┌─╴Mod\n  ┌─╴SubMod ~ X\n    X ← 5\n  └─╴\n└─╴\nMod~X"/> // Should fail
        <p>"Names must be re-bound in the parent to be made visible."</p>
        <Editor example="┌─╴Mod\n  ┌─╴SubMod\n    X ← 5\n  └─╴\n  X ← SubMod~X\n└─╴\nMod~X"/>
        <p>"Names defined above the module can be referenced inside it."</p>
        <Editor example="B ← 5\n┌─╴Mod\n  C ← ×2 B\n└─╴\nMod~C"/>

        <Hd id="modules-as-functions">"Modules as Functions"</Hd>
        <p>"If a module defines a function called "<code>"Call"</code>" or "<code>"New"</code>", it can be called as a function. This can be useful if your module defines functions that all work on the same kind of data, like methods in some other languages."</p>
        <Editor example="┌─╴Foo\n  New ← {⊓$Bar$Baz}\n  Format ← /$\"_ _\"\n└─╴\nFoo \"Hi!\" 5\nFoo~Format ."/>

        <Hd id="module-import-macros">"Module Import Macros"</Hd>
        <p>"If the name of a module is referenced as a macro (with a trailing "<code>"!"</code>"), names defined in the module will be available in the macro's scope."</p>
        <p>"This is useful if you need to refer to a bunch of bindings from a module without having to prefix them with the module name."</p>
        <Editor example="┌─╴Foo\n  New ← {⊓$Bar$Baz}\n  Format ← /$\"_ _\"\n  Incr ← ⍜⊣(+1)\n└─╴\nFoo!(Format Incr New) \"Oh\" 10"/>

        <Hd id="web-files">"Files on the Website"</Hd>
        <p>"Using files as modules involves loading files from the file system."</p>
        <p>"This website has a virtual file system. You can write to virtual files with "<Prim prim=Sys(SysOp::FWriteAll)/>". You can also drag and drop files from your computer into the editor to make them available to import."</p>
        <p>"There is also a test module that can always be imported as "<code>"example.ua"</code>". Its contents is:"</p>
        <Editor example=EXAMPLE_UA/>

        <Hd id="importing">"Importing Modules"</Hd>
        <p>"Modules can be imported by file path with "<code>"~"</code>"."</p>
        <Editor example="~ \"example.ua\""/>
        <p>"This is not very useful on its own. We can bind items from the module in the current scope by listing them after the file path, separated by an additional "<code>"~"</code>"."</p>
        <Editor example="~ \"example.ua\" ~ Increment Square\n\nIncrement Square 3"/>
        <p>"If we have a lot of items to import, we can use multiple lines."</p>
        <Editor example="~ \"example.ua\"\n~ Increment Square\n~ Span\n~ Foo Bar\n\nIncrement Square Foo\nSpan 4 10"/>
        <p>"The formatter will automatically indent the imports if they are on multiple lines. It will also alphabetize them. Try it out!"</p>

        <Hd id="binding">"Binding Modules"</Hd>
        <p>"If we put a name before the import, we can bind the module to that name."</p>
        <p>"We can then reference items from that module anywhere using a "<code>"~"</code>"."</p>
        <Editor example="Ex ~ \"example.ua\"\n\nEx~Increment 10"/>
        <p>"This can be mixed and matched with the other import syntax."</p>
        <Editor example="Ex ~ \"example.ua\" ~ Increment Square\n\nEx~Double Square 3\nEx~Mac!×\nIncrement Ex~Bar"/>

        <Hd id="aliasing">"Aliasing Modules"</Hd>
        <p>"If you want to be able to refer to an item from a module with a different name, simply make a binding with the new name."</p>
        <Editor example="Ex ~ \"example.ua\"\nSqr ← Ex~Square\nSp ← Ex~Span\n\nSp⟜Sqr 3"/>
        <p>"These bindings will also get indented by the formatter if they immediately follow the import. Try formatting the above code!"</p>
        <p>"You can also re-bind the module itself."</p>
        <Editor example="Ex ~ \"example.ua\"\nLocalEx ← Ex\nLocalEx~Square 7"/>

        <Hd id="visibility">"Visibility"</Hd>
        <p>"All bindings in a module bound with the normal "<code>"←"</code>" arrow are public and can be used by importers of the module."</p>
        <p>"However, modules imported in modules, as well as their same-name imports (the names on lines that start with "<code>"~"</code>"), are private."</p>
        <p>"You may have noticed in the example file that one binding uses a special "<code>"↚"</code>" arrow. This indicates that the binding is private."</p>
        <p>"Private bindings cannot be accessed from outside the file in which they are defined."</p>
        <Editor example="~ \"example.ua\" ~ RangeDiff"/> // Should fail
        <p>"To enter this arrow, you can put a "<code>"~"</code>" after a binding's normal "<code>"←"</code>" or "<code>"="</code>"."</p>
        <p>"Try formatting the following example to see how this works."</p>
        <Editor example="A = +1\nB ← +2\nC =~ +3\nD ←~ +4"/>

        <Hd id="git-modules">"Git Modules"</Hd>
        <p>"Modules can be imported from Git repositories. Instead of a path, use a URL prefixed with "<code>"git:"</code>"."</p>
        <p>"The "{lang}" GitHub organization hosts an example module at "<a href="https://github.com/uiua-lang/example-module">"https://github.com/uiua-lang/example-module"</a>". The protocol specification can be omitted."</p>
        <Editor example="~ \"git: github.com/uiua-lang/example-module\" ~ Upscale\nUpscale 3 [1_2 3_4]"/>
        <p>"On the site, code is pulled from a "<code>"lib.ua"</code>" file at the root of the repository. Loading other files on the site is not supported."</p>
        <p>"To use Git modules in the "<A href="/docs/install">"native interpreter"</A>", you must have Git installed. The repository is cloned and the "<code>"lib.ua"</code>" file is loaded as the module's contents. Code from other files can be made available by importing them as modules in the "<code>"lib.ua"</code>" file."</p>
        <p>"The native interpreter also supports adding an additional "<code>"branch: <branch-name>"</code>" or "<code>"commit: <commit-hash>"</code>" specifier after the URL."</p>
        <p>"The "<code>"uiua module"</code>" command can be used to list or update Git modules."</p>
        <p>"You can find a curated list of "{lang}" modules "<a href="https://github.com/uiua-lang/uiua-modules">"here"</a>"."</p>
