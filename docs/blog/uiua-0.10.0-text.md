# Announcing Uiua 0.10.0

2024-04-04

---

Uiua 0.10.0 is now available!

You can find the full changelog [here](https://uiua.org/docs/changelog#0.10.0---2024-04-04).

This release contains so many changes, improvements, and new features that I thought it deserved a blog post.
From here on, major releases will be announced in this way.

While there are many changes, I want to highlight a few of them here.

## Pattern Matching

Using [`un`](https://uiua.org/docs/un) on a constant value will now match a pattern. When used with [`try`](https://uiua.org/docs/try), this can be used to conditionally match, extract, and process values.

```uiua
F ‚Üê ‚ç£(
  √ó10 ¬∞[1‚äô3] # Extract and multiply..
| ¬∞(‚äÇ5)      # ..or remove leading 5..
| ‚áå          # ..else reverse
)
F [1 2 3]
F [5 6 7]
F "cool!"
```
You can read more in the [Pattern Matching](https://uiua.org/tutorial/Pattern Matching) tutorial.

## Array Macros

Array macros are a powerful new feature that allow full compile-time metaprogramming.

They allow Uiua code to directly manipulate other Uiua code, enabling a wide range of new possibilities.

```uiua
F! ‚Üê^ ‚â°$"_ ‚Üê _\n" "ABC"
F!(1|2|3)
[A B C B B]
```

You can read more in the updated [Macros](https://uiua.org/tutorial/Macros) tutorial.

## Git Modules

You can now prefix a module path with `git:` to import a git repository from a URL.
```uiua
~ "git: github.com/uiua-lang/example-module" ~ Upscale
Upscale 3 [1_2 3_4]
```
In the native interpreter, this automatically creates a Git submodule.

On the web, it fetches a `lib.ua` file from the repository.

You can read more in the updated [Modules](https://uiua.org/tutorial/Modules) tutorial.

## [`mask`](https://uiua.org/docs/mask)

[`mask`](https://uiua.org/docs/mask) is a new function that is similar to [`find`](https://uiua.org/docs/find), but it returns full masks of matches rather than just the first positions.

```uiua
‚¶∑ " - " "Hey - how-are -  you"
```
```uiua
‚äú‚ñ°¬¨‚¶∑‚äô. " - " "Hey - how-are -  you"
```

This simplifies a lot of string-processing code in particular. A new [strings](https://uiua.org/tutorial/strings) tutorial has been added as well.

## Other Changes

Switch functions now format to use `‚ü®‚ü©` brackets. This makes them easier to distinguish from function packs.
```uiua
F ‚Üê (√ó10|‚Ü•2)<2. # This..
F ‚Üê ‚ü®√ó10|‚Ü•2‚ü©<2. # Formats to this
F 0
F 5
```

[`map`](https://uiua.org/docs/map) and related functions are no longer experimental! See the [`map`](https://uiua.org/docs/map) docs for an overview.
```uiua
map 1_2_3 4_5_6
```

The new [`&clget`](https://uiua.org/docs/&clget) and [`&clset`](https://uiua.org/docs/&clset) functions provide access to the clipboard.

The interpreter's built-in language server now supports [many more features](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=uiua-lang.uiua-vscode).

There are a ton more! Again, you can read the full changelog [here](https://uiua.org/docs/changelog#0.10.0---2024-04-04).

## üíñ

As always, I'd like to thank everyone who contributed to this release, whether by directly contributing code, reporting bugs, or just using Uiua and providing feedback.

Uiua is in many ways a novel and unique language, and I think it is only through our collective effort that we can properly explore its design space.

With your help, I hope to continue to improve Uiua to the point of stability.
