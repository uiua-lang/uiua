Kala's pronouns are she/her. She will now appear in various places on the Uiua website. Feel free to use images of her anywhere!

Uiua now continues the rich history of programming [languages](https://www.php.net/elephpant.php) [having](https://go.dev/blog/gopher) [fun](https://rustacean.net/) [animal](https://github.com/ziglang/logo?tab=readme-ov-file#official-mascots) [mascots](https://gleam.run/branding/).

Kala's design was inspired by a drawing from Uiua community member Jacob Lockwood:

Kala's vector design was created by artist [Nikola D](https://pro.fiverr.com/freelancers/johnny_kelevra?source=gig_page).

The commission of this art was made possible by the generosity of [Sonja Lang](https://tokipona.org/madame_lang), creator of [Toki Pona](https://tokipona.org/) and a wonderful friend to the Uiua community. Thank you so much! ❤️

Here are all the images that will now be used on the Uiua website, particularly in the tutorial:
