# Uiua Changelog

Uiua is not yet stable.

## 0.9.0 - 2024-??-??
This version is not yet released. If you are reading this on the website, then these changes are live here.
### Language
- **Breaking Change** - [`repeat ⍥`](https://uiua.org/docs/repeat) with [`infinity ∞`](https://uiua.org/docs/infinity) now does a fixed-point iteration rather than an infinite loop
  - You can still do an infinite loop with [`do ⍢`](https://uiua.org/docs/do)`(…)1`
- **Breaking Change** - [`reshape ↯`](https://uiua.org/docs/reshape) with a shape with negative dimensions now reverses that axis rather than acting as a "fill" value
  - The "fill" behavior can still be achieved by setting an axis to [`infinity ∞`](https://uiua.org/docs/infinity)
- Overhaul the module system
  - Details can be found in the updated [Modules](https://uiua.org/tutorial/modules) tutorial
  - Deprecate [`&i`](https://uiua.org/docs/&i), as it is no longer necessary
- Add the [`on ⟜`](https://uiua.org/docs/on) modifier, which captures a common [`fork ⊃`](https://uiua.org/docs/fork) pattern in a more readable way
- [`join ⊂`](https://uiua.org/docs/join) can now be used with [`under ⍜`](https://uiua.org/docs/under)
  - This only works when the joined arrays have different ranks
- [`join ⊂`](https://uiua.org/docs/join) can now be used with [`un °`](https://uiua.org/docs/un) to separate the first row of an array from the rest
- [`try ⍣`](https://uiua.org/docs/try)'s handler's function signature is now more flexible
  - This makes it easier to either provide a default value, process the error itself, or do something different with the inputs
- A [`fill ⬚`](https://uiua.org/docs/fill) value set outside a looping modifier will now no longer be available inside the loop
  - This should make it easier to scope [`fill ⬚`](https://uiua.org/docs/fill) correctly
- Add recursion via refering to a binding's name within its body
  - Deprecate [`this ↬`](https://uiua.org/docs/this) and [`recur ↫`](https://uiua.org/docs/recur), as they are no longer necessary
- Extend some math functions to work with characters
  - [`sign ±`](https://uiua.org/docs/sign) gets the case of a character
  - [`absolute value ⌵`](https://uiua.org/docs/absolute) uppercases a character
  - [`negate ¯`](https://uiua.org/docs/negate) toggles the case of a character
- [`range ⇡`](https://uiua.org/docs/range) can now be used with negative numbers
- [`eta η`](https://uiua.org/docs/eta), [`pi π`](https://uiua.org/docs/pi), [`tau τ`](https://uiua.org/docs/tau) and [`infinity ∞`](https://uiua.org/docs/infinity) are now parsed as numbers rather than functions
  - This lets them syntactically bind with `¯` or form fraction literals
- Add the [`inventory ⍚`](https://uiua.org/docs/inventory) modifier, which iterates over the unboxed items of an array and re-boxes the results
  - This shortens a lot of box array code
- Change [`content ◇`](https://uiua.org/docs/content)'s glyph to reflect its relationship with [`inventory ⍚`](https://uiua.org/docs/inventory). Code using `⊔` will continue to work and will be formatted as `◇`.
- Custom modifiers with 2 or more arguments can now use `‼` at the end of their names. Modifier names with any combination of `!` and `‼` will be automatically parsed and formatted as `‼`s followed by one `!` if necessary.
- `f` can now be used at the beginning of planet notation shorthand for [`fork ⊃`](https://uiua.org/docs/fork)
- Inline functions are no longer required to be in a binding or modifier
  - This allows arbitrary code to be wrapped and marked with a signature
- Remove cosine and arccosine optimizations
  - The inverse of the cosine idiom created a logical inconsistency
- Flip the order of [`send`](https://uiua.org/docs/send)'s arguments
- Add the [`pool`](https://uiua.org/docs/pool) modifier, which is identical to [`spawn`](https://uiua.org/docs/spawn) but spawns a thread in a thread pool
- [`&rs`](https://uiua.org/docs/&rs) can now take a count of [`infinity ∞`](https://uiua.org/docs/infinity) to read until the end of the stream
- Add the [`&runs`](https://uiua.org/docs/&runs) system function, which runs a command and returns an IO stream handle
- Add the experimental [`&ffi`](https://uiua.org/docs/&ffi) system function, which allows calling functions from shared libraries
  - FFI is still a work in progress, but it is currently useful for foreign functions that aren't too complex
  - Bindings for [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) are being worked on as a proof of concept. You can find them in the [rayua](https://github.com/uiua-lang/rayua) repository.
- Add experimental function strands. Putting a `_` between two functions (or a function and a constant), is equivalent to putting them in `()`s
  - This is experimental because it remains to be seen how this may affect readability
- Add experimental labels, denoted by a `$` immediately followed by an identifier, which attach a name to an array. This has two uses:
  - Labels are visible in output and in [`stack`](https://uiua.org/docs/stack) diagnostics
  - Labels in code make it easier to understand when reading
- Add experimental [`shapes`](https://uiua.org/docs/shapes) and [`types`](https://uiua.org/docs/types) modifiers, which validate the shape and type of an array or arrays
  - These both check array properties at runtime and serve as a form of documentation
- [`&var`](https://uiua.org/docs/&var) now throws an error if the variable is not found
- Deprecate [`pop ◌`](https://uiua.org/docs/pop) formatting from `;`
- Deprecate [`all ⋔`](https://uiua.org/docs/all)
  - It was rarely used and was hard to reason about
- Add an experimental `repr` function that produces a string representation of a value in a format that can be read by the interpreter
### Interpreter
- Numbers that seem to have a floating-point epsilon rounding error will be output with the epsilon noted
- Optimize the pattern for adjacency: [`≡`](https://uiua.org/docs/rows)[`/`](https://uiua.org/docs/reduce)`F`[`◫`](https://uiua.org/docs/windows)
  - It is as much as 800x faster in some cases
- Square matrices are now transposed in-place
- Language Server
  - Add completions
  - Add diagnostics
  - Add semantic highlighting
  - Add inline function hovering
  - Show [`un °`](https://uiua.org/docs/un)/[`under ⍜`](https://uiua.org/docs/under) compatibility for user-defined functions
### Website
- Add [Tutorial Introduction](https://uiua.org/tutorial/introduction)
- Add [primitives.json](https://uiua.org/primitives.json) for use with tooling
- Tutorials are now in a `/tutorial` route instead of `/docs`

## 0.8.0 - 2024-01-31
### Language
- Add the [`content ◇`](https://uiua.org/docs/content) modifier, which unboxes its function's arguments before calling it
  - Deprecate [`unpack ⊐`](https://uiua.org/docs/unpack) in favor of [`content ◇`](https://uiua.org/docs/content)
  - The behavior of [`content ◇`](https://uiua.org/docs/content) is less implicit and is not prone to some of the potential unexpected behavior of [`unpack ⊐`](https://uiua.org/docs/unpack)
- Add the [`unique ◰`](https://uiua.org/docs/unique) function, which creates a mask of the first occurrence of each unique value in an array
  - Change [`deduplicate ◴`](https://uiua.org/docs/deduplicate)'s glyph to reflect its relationship with [`unique ◰`](https://uiua.org/docs/unique). Code using `⊖` will continue to work and will be formatted as `◴`.
- [`table ⊞`](https://uiua.org/docs/table) now works on rows of arrays but keeps it's optimizations for lists
  - You never wanted element-wise combinations of multi-dimensional arrays anyway
  - Deprecate [`cross ⊠`](https://uiua.org/docs/cross), as it is now redundant
  - This is technically a breaking change, but it is unlikely to break much code
- [`fill ⬚`](https://uiua.org/docs/fill) can now be used to specify default accumulators for [`reduce /`](https://uiua.org/docs/reduce), [`group ⊕`](https://uiua.org/docs/group), and [`partition ⊜`](https://uiua.org/docs/partition)
  - **Breaking Change** - Reducing [`group ⊕`](https://uiua.org/docs/group) and [`partition ⊜`](https://uiua.org/docs/partition) no longer take a required accumulator
  - **Breaking Change** - [`fill ⬚`](https://uiua.org/docs/fill) can no longer be temporarily disabled. Try to scope it to the smallest function.
- **Breaking Change** - Most non-pervasive monadic functions no longer implicitely unbox their argument
  - This impliciteness led to some unexpected behavior, particularly when getting the [`length ⧻`](https://uiua.org/docs/length) or [`shape △`](https://uiua.org/docs/shape) of a boxed array
  - Exceptions are [`reverse ⇌`](https://uiua.org/docs/reverse) and [`transpose ⍉`](https://uiua.org/docs/transpose), which work on box elements without unboxing them
- Unicode escape sequences that are not 2 or 4 hex digits long can now be specified with `\u{…}`
- Change [`pop ◌`](https://uiua.org/docs/pop)'s glyph to make it look good in planet notation. Code using `;` will continue to work and will be formatted as `◌`.
- [`un °`](https://uiua.org/docs/un)[`reduce /`](https://uiua.org/docs/reduce)[`multiply ×`](https://uiua.org/docs/multiply) now gives the prime factorization of a number
- [`classify ⊛`](https://uiua.org/docs/classify) and [`deduplicate ◴`](https://uiua.org/docs/deduplicate) now work with [`under ⍜`](https://uiua.org/docs/under)
- [`&fras`](https://uiua.org/docs/&fras) and [`&frab`](https://uiua.org/docs/&frab) now work with [`under ⍜`](https://uiua.org/docs/under)
- Completely remove the deprecated `unbox ⊔`
- Add experimental hashmap functions, which operate on a box array as if it is a hashmap
  - [`map`](https://uiua.org/docs/map)
  - [`has`](https://uiua.org/docs/has)
  - [`get`](https://uiua.org/docs/get)
  - [`insert`](https://uiua.org/docs/insert)
  - [`remove`](https://uiua.org/docs/remove)
- Add experimental [`bind`](https://uiua.org/docs/bind) modifier, which binds local values within a function
  - This introduces some non-tacitness to the language
### Interpreter
- The internal byte array type is now used in more places, which should improve performance a bit
- [`&ime`](https://uiua.org/docs/&ime) and [`&imd`](https://uiua.org/docs/&imd) now support the QOI image format

- [`setinv`](https://uiua.org/docs/setinv) and [`setund`](https://uiua.org/docs/setund) are no longer experimental
- Add output comments, which the formatter fills with values from the stack
  - Make an empty comment starting with `n` additional `#`s

- Make placeholders work properly with [`both ∩`](https://uiua.org/docs/both)
- Some other bug and crash fixes

## 0.6.0 - 2023-12-06
### Language
- [`fix ¤`](https://uiua.org/docs/fix) now works with binary pervasive functions
  - This removes the need for some uses of [`rows ≡`](https://uiua.org/docs/rows) and should be a bit faster
- [`fill ⬚`](https://uiua.org/docs/fill) can now be disabled for a function by filling with an empty list
- [`parse ⋕`](https://uiua.org/docs/parse) now has a glyph and is semi-pervasive
  - It was being used enough to warrant a glyph

- Add some missing arithmetic inverses and unders involving [`flip :`](https://uiua.org/docs/flip)
- Change `pack`'s name to [`unpack ⊐`](https://uiua.org/docs/unpack), and it no longer implicitly boxes values (only unboxes them)
  - Implicit boxing could lead to unexpected and inconsistent behavior
- Change `invert`'s name and glyph to [`un °`](https://uiua.org/docs/un). Code using `⍘` will continue to work and will be formatted as `°`.
  - `°` is a nicer glyph, and `un` composes more nicely with the names of invertible functions
- Deprecate `unbox ⊔` in favor of [`un °`](https://uiua.org/docs/un) [`box □`](https://uiua.org/docs/box)
  - It can still be typed the same way!
- Deprecate [`reduce /`](https://uiua.org/docs/reduce) with a monadic function
  - This created poorly-defined stack signatures that changed depending on the length of the array being reduced
  - [`un °`](https://uiua.org/docs/un) with stack array and planet notations, i.e. `°[⊙⊙∘]`, can be used instead, as it has a well-defined signature
  - For operating on just part of an array, use [`under ⍜`](https://uiua.org/docs/under) [`take ↙`](https://uiua.org/docs/take), [`drop ↘`](https://uiua.org/docs/drop), or [`select ⊏`](https://uiua.org/docs/select)

## 0.0.22 - 2023-10-21
### Language
- Custom modifier placeholders (`^`) must now be immediately followed by a signature. This reduces the number of signatures that have to be declared everywhere else.

## 0.0.21 - 2023-10-21
### Language
- **Massive Change** - Functions are no longer first-class values. This has many implications:
  - Functions can no longer be put in arrays or manipulated as stack values
  - Inline functions can now only appear as modifier arguments or bindings
  - `call !` has been removed, as there is nothing on the stack to call
  - Modules have been reworked. [`&i`](https://uiua.org/docs/&i) now handles both loading a module from a file and importing items from that module.
  - `---` scopes are now test scopes. `~~~` scopes have been removed.
  - Remove `use`, as it is no longer necessary
  - Boxes still work as normal, but are now their own type distinct from functions
  - Remove `sig`, as everything that can be on the stack now has the same signature
- Add new syntax for defining [custom modifiers](https://uiua.org/tutorial/custommodifiers)
- Add new syntax for [calling a function from a list of functions](https://uiua.org/tutorial/controlflow#switch)
- Add the `pack ⊐` modifier, which calls its function and implicitly boxes/unboxes values
- Add the `combinate ◳` modifier, which is a rank-generic version of [`table ⊞`](https://uiua.org/docs/table)
- [`fold ∧`](https://uiua.org/docs/fold) is now rank-generic and requires a rank list
- Add the `tribute ≐` modifier, which is a flipped version of `distribute ∺`
- Change `level ≑`'s glyph to reflect its relationship with [`each ∵`](https://uiua.org/docs/each), [`rows ≡`](https://uiua.org/docs/rows), `distribute ∺`, and `tribute ≐`. Code using `⍚` will continue to work and will be formatted as `≑`.
- Add `rock ⍘`, `surface ~`, `deep ≊`, `abyss ≃`, and `seabed ∸`, which build rank lists to be used with `level ≑` and the new rank-generic modifiers
- Change [`trace ⸮`](https://uiua.org/docs/trace)'s glyph to let `surface ~` use `~`.
- Change [`match ≍`](https://uiua.org/docs/match)'s glyph to avoid confusion with the new ocean functions' glyphs. Code using `≅` will continue to work and will be formatted as `≍`.
- Stack signatures found to be incorrect at runtime produce an error
- Dyadic math operations now work with [`under ⍜`](https://uiua.org/docs/under) even if both arguments are outside [`under ⍜`](https://uiua.org/docs/under)'s function
- Some mathematical functions that previously did not work with [`invert ⍘`](https://uiua.org/docs/un) and [`under ⍜`](https://uiua.org/docs/under) when accompanied by [`flip :`](https://uiua.org/docs/flip) now do
