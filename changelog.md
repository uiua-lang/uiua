### Interpreter
- Various bug fixes related to shapes, types, fills, and optimizations

## 0.14.0 - 2024-12-20
You can find the release announcement [here](https://uiua.org/blog/uiua-0.14.0).
### Language
- **Breaking Change**: Multi-argument [`group ‚äï`](https://uiua.org/docs/group) and [`partition ‚äú`](https://uiua.org/docs/partition) no longer do reduction. Instead, multiple groups are passed to the function.
  - The reducing versions were rarely used
  - This new behavior is more useful
- **Breaking Change**: [`un ¬∞`](https://uiua.org/docs/un) [`json`](https://uiua.org/docs/json) no longer attempts to form multidimensional arrays
  - This makes deserializing JSON more consistent
- **Breaking Change**: [`fill ‚¨ö`](https://uiua.org/docs/fill)ed [`scan \\`](https://uiua.org/docs/scan) now sets the initial value as well as filling row shapes
  - This behavior is hard to get otherwise
  - Fixes to existing code should be simple
- **Breaking Change**: [`obverse ‚åÖ`](https://uiua.org/docs/obverse) with a single function now just nullifies the inverse
  - This makes a lot of common [`under ‚çú`](https://uiua.org/docs/under) patterns much simpler
- **Breaking Change**: Negative indices to [`pick ‚ä°`](https://uiua.org/docs/pick) and [`select ‚äè`](https://uiua.org/docs/select) now always use a fill value if available
- Stabilize [subscripts](https://uiua.org/docs/subscripts)!
  - They make available a lot of nice functionality
  - Allow negative subscripts
  - Add experimental [sided subscripts](https://uiua.org/docs/subscripts#sided)
- [`rows ‚â°`](https://uiua.org/docs/rows), [`inventory ‚çö`](https://uiua.org/docs/inventory), and [`each ‚àµ`](https://uiua.org/docs/each) now support subscripts
- [`deshape ‚ô≠`](https://uiua.org/docs/deshape) now supports subscripts
  - Axes are collapsed to get the given rank
- Deprecate [`rerank ‚òá`](https://uiua.org/docs/rerank)
  - It was basically always used with a static rank, and that functionality has been subsumed by subscripted [`deshape ‚ô≠`](https://uiua.org/docs/deshape) and/or the iterating modifiers listed above
  - The dynamic behavior can still be accessed with `¬∞‚ä∏(‚ßª‚ñ≥)` (though when you would need this is unclear)
- Add the [`stencil ‚ßà`](https://uiua.org/docs/stencil) modifier, which is a generalization of [`windows ‚ó´`](https://uiua.org/docs/windows)
  - `‚ßà‚àò` is equivalent to [`windows ‚ó´`](https://uiua.org/docs/windows)
  - [`windows ‚ó´`](https://uiua.org/docs/windows) has been deprecated. All existing uses will continue to work and will be formatted as `‚ßà‚àò`.
- [`get`](https://uiua.org/docs/get), [`has`](https://uiua.org/docs/has), and [`remove`](https://uiua.org/docs/remove) now support working on multiple key-value pairs at once
- Deprecate [`trace ‚∏Æ`](https://uiua.org/docs/trace)
  - It is equivalent to subscripted [`stack ?`](https://uiua.org/docs/stack)
  - Sequential `?`s, which formatted to [`trace ‚∏Æ`](https://uiua.org/docs/trace)s, now format to subscripted [`stack ?`](https://uiua.org/docs/stack)
- Stabilize [`tuples ‚ßÖ`](https://uiua.org/docs/tuples)
- Stabilize [`sort ‚çÜ`](https://uiua.org/docs/sort)
  - Sorting is a very common operation, and it's useful to have such simple access to it
- Stabilize [`last ‚ä£`](https://uiua.org/docs/last)
  - Getting the last row is a very common operation
- Stabilize [`case ‚ç©`](https://uiua.org/docs/case)
- Add the [`path`](https://uiua.org/docs/path) modifier, which finds shortest paths
  - Replaces and deprecates [`astar`](https://uiua.org/docs/astar)
  - `astar`'s functionality is still available via [`path`](https://uiua.org/docs/path) with a function pack
- Add the `A‚ÇÅ`, `A‚ÇÇ`, `A‚ÇÉ`, `C‚ÇÇ`, `C‚ÇÉ`, and `E‚ÇÉ` constants which are various kinds of adjacency offsets
  - They are great for working with [`path`](https://uiua.org/docs/path)
- Declared signatures that do not match the inferred signature will now cause a warning rather than an error
  - The function is edited to make the signature correct
- [`orient ‚§∏`](https://uiua.org/docs/orient) can now use [`fill ‚¨ö`](https://uiua.org/docs/fill) to fill in new dimensions
- [`un ¬∞`](https://uiua.org/docs/un) [`reduce /`](https://uiua.org/docs/reduce) (format string) now splits a string by a delimiter
- [`do ‚ç¢`](https://uiua.org/docs/do) now runs its functions at least once, even if their signatures are invalid
  - This is helpful when initially setting up a loop
- [`un ¬∞`](https://uiua.org/docs/un) now works with [`repeat ‚ç•`](https://uiua.org/docs/repeat) without a repetition count
  - This counts the number of repetitions required to converge
- Add an `Œµ` shadowable constant for the machine epsilon
  - You can type it as `\\epsilon`
  - Other greek letters can also be typed this way
- Add [`&ep`](https://uiua.org/docs/&ep) and [`&epf`](https://uiua.org/docs/&epf) system functions for easier printing to stderr
- Functions that work with audio such as [`audio`](https://uiua.org/docs/audio) now treat the first axis as samples and the second axis as channels
- Add [`# Deprecated!`](https://www.uiua.org/tutorial/documentation#deprecated) semantic comments
- Change [`backward ùÑà`](https://uiua.org/docs/backward)'s glyph to `ùÑà`. Code using `Àú` will continue to work and will be formatted as `ùÑà`.
- Add the experimental [`or ‚à®`](https://uiua.org/docs/or) function
  - It has a useful reduction identity
  - It is also GCD
- Add experimental [inline macros](https://www.uiua.org/docs/experimental#inline-macros)
  - Deprecate the experimental `stringify` and `signature` modifiers in favor of inline code macros
- Add experimental [`binary`](https://uiua.org/docs/binary) function, which encodes and decodes arrays into a compact binary representation

  - As planned, [`memberof ‚àä`](https://uiua.org/docs/memberof)'s glyph has been changed, and the old one will format to `‚àä`.
- Remove the previously deprecated experimental `‚üî coordinate` function
- Remove the previously deprecated experimental `struct` modifier
- Remove the previously deprecated `setinv` and `setund` modifiers
- Remove the previously deprecated `choose` and `permute` functions
- Remove the previously deprecated experimental `‚óπ triangle` modifier
- Remove the previously deprecated experimental `‚ëÑ chunks` function
### Interpreter
- The compiler and interpreter have been almost entirely rewritten to use a tree-based execution model rather than a bytecode model
  - This massively simplifies compilation as well as optimizations and the derivation of inverses
  - This should not affect any language semantics
- Improve pattern matching error messages
- Optimize the "root" pattern `‚Åø%:1`
- Optimize format strings applied to strings or boxed strings
- Optimize common [`partition ‚äú`](https://uiua.org/docs/partition) patterns

### Language
- **Breaking Change** - [`minimum ‚Üß`](https://uiua.org/docs/minimum) and [`maximum ‚Ü•`](https://uiua.org/docs/maximum) now compare boxes lexicographically
  - This makes them consistent with comparison functions like [`less than <`](https://uiua.org/docs/less%20than)
- **Breaking Change** - [`gen`](https://uiua.org/docs/gen) now takes a shape argument and no longer outputs a new seed
- **Breaking Change** - [`&clip`](https://uiua.org/docs/&clip) now unifies `&clget` and `&clset`
- **Breaking Change** - [`type`](https://uiua.org/docs/type) numbers are now:
  - `0` for normal numbers
  - `1` for characters
  - `2` for boxes
  - `3` for complex numbers
  - This orders the types more or less as you're likely to need to handle them
  - In the future, if another number type is added, it can go at the end next to complex numbers
- The experimental `chunks ‚ëÑ` function's behavior has been moved to an extension on [`windows ‚ó´`](https://uiua.org/docs/windows)
  - This also allows the specification of "stride"

  - See the updated [Testing Tutorial](https://uiua.org/tutorial/testing) for more information
- [`parse ‚ãï`](https://uiua.org/docs/parse) now parses complex values from both `arbi`and `a+bi` formats
  - [`un ¬∞`](https://uiua.org/docs/un)[`parse ‚ãï`](https://uiua.org/docs/parse)'s return value uses the `arbi` format
- [`un ¬∞`](https://uiua.org/docs/un) [`orient ‚§∏`](https://uiua.org/docs/orient) is now equivalent to [`range ‚á°`](https://uiua.org/docs/range) [`length ‚ßª`](https://uiua.org/docs/length) [`shape ‚ñ≥`](https://uiua.org/docs/shape) [`duplicate .`](https://uiua.org/docs/duplicate)
  - This is analogous to the behavior of [`un ¬∞`](https://uiua.org/docs/un) [`select ‚äè`](https://uiua.org/docs/select)
- Add a feature to some [`under ‚çú`](https://uiua.org/docs/under) functions that makes them more permissive of changes in rank

  - For example `‚çú‚áå¬∞‚äÇ` behaves in a more useful way
- [`under ‚çú`](https://uiua.org/docs/under) [`length ‚ßª`](https://uiua.org/docs/len) now reshapes an array to have the transformed length
- `NaN` and `‚àû` indices for [`pick ‚ä°`](https://uiua.org/docs/pick) and [`select ‚äè`](https://uiua.org/docs/select) now get the [`fill ‚¨ö`](https://uiua.org/docs/fill) value

## 0.12.0 - 2024-08-16
You can find the release announcement [here](https://uiua.org/blog/uiua-0.12.0).
### Language
- **Breaking Change** - [`&runs`](https://uiua.org/docs/&runs) now returns 3 handles rather than 1
  - This gives more precise control over stdin, stdout, and stderr
- **Breaking Change** - [`un ¬∞`](https://uiua.org/docs/un) [`select ‚äè`](https://uiua.org/docs/select) is now equivalent to [`range ‚á°`](https://uiua.org/docs/range) [`length ‚ßª`](https://uiua.org/docs/length) [`duplicate .`](https://uiua.org/docs/duplicate)
- **Breaking Change** - [`auden`](https://uiua.org/docs/audio) now takes a sample rate argument, and [`un ¬∞`](https://uiua.org/docs/un)[`auden`](https://uiua.org/docs/audio) now returns the sample rate
  - This allows you to work with audio that is not at Uiua's default sample rate
- **Breaking Change** - [`fill ‚¨ö`](https://uiua.org/docs/fill) no longer fills the shapes of inputs to [`rows ‚â°`](https://uiua.org/docs/rows)
  - It could lead to some unexpected behavior when trying to fill the shapes of outputs

- Switch functions have been replaced with a [`switch ‚®¨`](https://uiua.org/docs/switch) modifier
  - This makes the language more uniform
  - Code with existing switch functions in `‚ü®‚ü©`s will continue to work and will format to use `‚®¨` and `()`s

## 0.9.0 - 2024-02-25
### Language
- **Breaking Change** - [`repeat ‚ç•`](https://uiua.org/docs/repeat) with [`infinity ‚àû`](https://uiua.org/docs/infinity) now does a fixed-point iteration rather than an infinite loop
  - You can still do an infinite loop with [`do ‚ç¢`](https://uiua.org/docs/do)`(‚Ä¶)1`
- **Breaking Change** - [`reshape ‚ÜØ`](https://uiua.org/docs/reshape) with a shape with negative dimensions now reverses that axis rather than acting as a "fill" value
  - The "fill" behavior can still be achieved by setting an axis to [`infinity ‚àû`](https://uiua.org/docs/infinity)
- **Breaking Change** - [`&ad`](https://uiua.org/docs/&ad) and [`&imd`](https://uiua.org/docs/&imd) now return an encoding format as a string in addition to the media data
  - They are also now deprecated in favor of using [`un ¬∞`](https://uiua.org/docs/un) with [`&ae`](https://uiua.org/docs/audio) or [`&ime`](https://uiua.org/docs/img)
- Overhaul the module system
  - Details can be found in the updated [Modules](https://uiua.org/tutorial/modules) tutorial
  - Deprecate [`&i`](https://uiua.org/docs/&i), as it is no longer necessary
  - Enabling experimental allows a module path of the form `git: <repo url>` to load a module from a git repository
- Custom modifiers are now called "macros"
  - Rather than requiring signatures, placeholders are now a sort of function that operates on the macro's arguments
  - This allows for more complex and flexible code-reuse
  - Existing code should continue to work. Existing placeholders will be formatted into the new syntax.
  - You can read more about macros in the updated [Macros](https://uiua.org/tutorial/macros) tutorial
- Add the [`on ‚üú`](https://uiua.org/docs/on) modifier, which captures a common [`fork ‚äÉ`](https://uiua.org/docs/fork) pattern in a more readable way
- [`join ‚äÇ`](https://uiua.org/docs/join) can now be used with [`under ‚çú`](https://uiua.org/docs/under)
  - This only works when the joined arrays have different ranks
- [`join ‚äÇ`](https://uiua.org/docs/join) can now be used with [`un ¬∞`](https://uiua.org/docs/un) to separate the first row of an array from the rest
- [`try ‚ç£`](https://uiua.org/docs/try)'s handler's function signature is now more flexible
  - This makes it easier to either provide a default value, process the error itself, or do something different with the inputs
- A [`fill ‚¨ö`](https://uiua.org/docs/fill) value set outside a looping modifier will now no longer be available inside the loop
  - This should make it easier to scope [`fill ‚¨ö`](https://uiua.org/docs/fill) correctly
- [`fill ‚¨ö`](https://uiua.org/docs/fill) can now match the lengths of inputs to [`rows ‚â°`](https://uiua.org/docs/rows)
- Add recursion via referring to a binding's name within its body
  - Deprecate [`this ‚Ü¨`](https://uiua.org/docs/this) and [`recur ‚Ü´`](https://uiua.org/docs/recur), as they are no longer necessary
- Extend some math functions to work with characters
  - [`sign ¬±`](https://uiua.org/docs/sign) gets the case of a character
  - [`absolute value ‚åµ`](https://uiua.org/docs/absolute) uppercases a character
  - [`negate ¬Ø`](https://uiua.org/docs/negate) toggles the case of a character
- [`range ‚á°`](https://uiua.org/docs/range) can now be used with negative numbers
- [`eta Œ∑`](https://uiua.org/docs/eta), [`pi œÄ`](https://uiua.org/docs/pi), [`tau œÑ`](https://uiua.org/docs/tau) and [`infinity ‚àû`](https://uiua.org/docs/infinity) are now parsed as numbers rather than functions
  - This lets them syntactically bind with `¬Ø` or form fraction literals
- Add the [`inventory ‚çö`](https://uiua.org/docs/inventory) modifier, which iterates over the unboxed items of an array and re-boxes the results
  - This shortens a lot of box array code
- Change [`content ‚óá`](https://uiua.org/docs/content)'s glyph to reflect its relationship with [`inventory ‚çö`](https://uiua.org/docs/inventory). Code using `‚äî` will continue to work and will be formatted as `‚óá`.
- [`content ‚óá`](https://uiua.org/docs/content) can now be used with [`under ‚çú`](https://uiua.org/docs/under) if its function does
- Macros with 2 or more arguments can now use `‚Äº` at the end of their names. Macro names with any combination of `!` and `‚Äº` will be automatically parsed and formatted as `‚Äº`s followed by one `!` if necessary.
- `f` can now be used at the beginning of planet notation shorthand for [`fork ‚äÉ`](https://uiua.org/docs/fork)
- Inline functions are no longer required to be in a binding or modifier
  - This allows arbitrary code to be wrapped and marked with a signature
- Remove cosine and arccosine optimizations
  - The inverse of the cosine idiom created a logical inconsistency
- [`pop ‚óå`](https://uiua.org/docs/pop) can now be used with [`under ‚çú`](https://uiua.org/docs/under)
  - This is only useful when [`pop ‚óå`](https://uiua.org/docs/pop) is composed with other functions
- **Breaking Change** - Flip the order of [`send`](https://uiua.org/docs/send)'s arguments
- Add the [`pool`](https://uiua.org/docs/pool) modifier, which is identical to [`spawn`](https://uiua.org/docs/spawn) but spawns a thread in a thread pool
- [`&rs`](https://uiua.org/docs/&rs) can now take a count of [`infinity ‚àû`](https://uiua.org/docs/infinity) to read until the end of the stream
- Add the [`&runs`](https://uiua.org/docs/&runs) system function, which runs a command and returns an IO stream handle
- Add the experimental [`stringify`](https://uiua.org/docs/stringify) modifier, which turns its function into a string without calling it
  - This is useful in macros
- Add the experimental [`signature`](https://uiua.org/docs/signature) modifier, which returns the arguments and output of its function without calling it
  - This is useful in macros
- Add the experimental [`&ffi`](https://uiua.org/docs/&ffi) system function, which allows calling functions from shared libraries
  - FFI is still a work in progress, but it is currently useful for foreign functions that aren't too complex
  - Bindings for [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) are being worked on as a proof of concept. You can find them in the [rayua](https://github.com/uiua-lang/rayua) repository.
- Add experimental function strands. Putting a `_` between two functions (or a function and a constant), is equivalent to putting them in `()`s
  - This is experimental because it remains to be seen how this may affect readability
- Add experimental labels, denoted by a `$` immediately followed by an identifier, which attach a name to an array. This has two uses:
  - Labels are visible in output and in [`stack`](https://uiua.org/docs/stack) diagnostics
  - Labels in code make it easier to understand when reading
- Add experimental [`shapes`](https://uiua.org/docs/shapes) and [`types`](https://uiua.org/docs/types) modifiers, which validate the shape and type of an array or arrays
  - These both check array properties at runtime and serve as a form of documentation
- [`&var`](https://uiua.org/docs/&var) now throws an error if the variable is not found
- Deprecate [`pop ‚óå`](https://uiua.org/docs/pop) formatting from `;`
- Deprecate [`all ‚ãî`](https://uiua.org/docs/all)
  - It was rarely used and was hard to reason about
- Add an experimental `repr` function that produces a string representation of a value in a format that can be read by the interpreter
### Interpreter
- Lots of bug and crash fixes
- Lots of performance improvements and optimizations
  - Optimize the pattern for adjacency: [`‚â°`](https://uiua.org/docs/rows)[`/`](https://uiua.org/docs/reduce)`F`[`‚ó´`](https://uiua.org/docs/windows)
    - It is as much as 800x faster in some cases
  - Optimize [`‚â°`](https://uiua.org/docs/rows)[`/`](https://uiua.org/docs/reduce)

## 0.8.0 - 2024-01-31
### Language
- Add the [`content ‚óá`](https://uiua.org/docs/content) modifier, which unboxes its function's arguments before calling it
  - Deprecate [`unpack ‚äê`](https://uiua.org/docs/unpack) in favor of [`content ‚óá`](https://uiua.org/docs/content)
  - The behavior of [`content ‚óá`](https://uiua.org/docs/content) is less implicit and is not prone to some of the potential unexpected behavior of [`unpack ‚äê`](https://uiua.org/docs/unpack)
- Add the [`unique ‚ó∞`](https://uiua.org/docs/unique) function, which creates a mask of the first occurrence of each unique value in an array
  - Change [`deduplicate ‚ó¥`](https://uiua.org/docs/deduplicate)'s glyph to reflect its relationship with [`unique ‚ó∞`](https://uiua.org/docs/unique). Code using `‚äñ` will continue to work and will be formatted as `‚ó¥`.
- [`table ‚äû`](https://uiua.org/docs/table) now works on rows of arrays but keeps it's optimizations for lists
  - You never wanted element-wise combinations of multi-dimensional arrays anyway
  - Deprecate [`cross ‚ä†`](https://uiua.org/docs/cross), as it is now redundant
  - This is technically a breaking change, but it is unlikely to break much code
- [`fill ‚¨ö`](https://uiua.org/docs/fill) can now be used to specify default accumulators for [`reduce /`](https://uiua.org/docs/reduce), [`group ‚äï`](https://uiua.org/docs/group), and [`partition ‚äú`](https://uiua.org/docs/partition)
  - **Breaking Change** - Reducing [`group ‚äï`](https://uiua.org/docs/group) and [`partition ‚äú`](https://uiua.org/docs/partition) no longer take a required accumulator
  - **Breaking Change** - [`fill ‚¨ö`](https://uiua.org/docs/fill) can no longer be temporarily disabled. Try to scope it to the smallest function.
- **Breaking Change** - Most non-pervasive monadic functions no longer implicitly unbox their argument
  - This implicitness led to some unexpected behavior, particularly when getting the [`length ‚ßª`](https://uiua.org/docs/length) or [`shape ‚ñ≥`](https://uiua.org/docs/shape) of a boxed array
  - Exceptions are [`reverse ‚áå`](https://uiua.org/docs/reverse) and [`transpose ‚çâ`](https://uiua.org/docs/transpose), which work on box elements without unboxing them
- Unicode escape sequences that are not 2 or 4 hex digits long can now be specified with `\u{‚Ä¶}`
- Change [`pop ‚óå`](https://uiua.org/docs/pop)'s glyph to make it look good in planet notation. Code using `;` will continue to work and will be formatted as `‚óå`.
- [`un ¬∞`](https://uiua.org/docs/un)[`reduce /`](https://uiua.org/docs/reduce)[`multiply √ó`](https://uiua.org/docs/multiply) now gives the prime factorization of a number
- [`classify ‚äõ`](https://uiua.org/docs/classify) and [`deduplicate ‚ó¥`](https://uiua.org/docs/deduplicate) now work with [`under ‚çú`](https://uiua.org/docs/under)
- [`&fras`](https://uiua.org/docs/&fras) and [`&frab`](https://uiua.org/docs/&frab) now work with [`under ‚çú`](https://uiua.org/docs/under)

- Some other bug and crash fixes

## 0.6.0 - 2023-12-06
### Language
- [`fix ¬§`](https://uiua.org/docs/fix) now works with binary pervasive functions
  - This removes the need for some uses of [`rows ‚â°`](https://uiua.org/docs/rows) and should be a bit faster
- [`fill ‚¨ö`](https://uiua.org/docs/fill) can now be disabled for a function by filling with an empty list
- [`parse ‚ãï`](https://uiua.org/docs/parse) now has a glyph and is semi-pervasive

- [`sign ¬±`](https://uiua.org/docs/sign), [`floor ‚åä`](https://uiua.org/docs/floor), [`ceiling ‚åà`](https://uiua.org/docs/ceiling), and [`round ‚ÅÖ`](https://uiua.org/docs/round) now work with [`under ‚çú`](https://uiua.org/docs/under)
- Add some missing arithmetic inverses and unders involving [`flip :`](https://uiua.org/docs/flip)
- Change `pack`'s name to [`unpack ‚äê`](https://uiua.org/docs/unpack), and it no longer implicitly boxes values (only unboxes them)
  - Implicit boxing could lead to unexpected and inconsistent behavior
- Change `invert`'s name and glyph to [`un ¬∞`](https://uiua.org/docs/un). Code using `‚çò` will continue to work and will be formatted as `¬∞`.

- Deprecate `unbox ‚äî` in favor of [`un ¬∞`](https://uiua.org/docs/un) [`box ‚ñ°`](https://uiua.org/docs/box)
  - It can still be typed the same way!
- Deprecate [`reduce /`](https://uiua.org/docs/reduce) with a monadic function
  - This created poorly-defined stack signatures that changed depending on the length of the array being reduced
  - [`un ¬∞`](https://uiua.org/docs/un) with stack array and planet notations, i.e. `¬∞[‚äô‚äô‚àò]`, can be used instead, as it has a well-defined signature
  - For operating on just part of an array, use [`under ‚çú`](https://uiua.org/docs/under) [`take ‚Üô`](https://uiua.org/docs/take), [`drop ‚Üò`](https://uiua.org/docs/drop), or [`select ‚äè`](https://uiua.org/docs/select)

- Change [`trace ‚∏Æ`](https://uiua.org/docs/trace)'s glyph to let `surface ~` use `~`.
- Change [`match ‚âç`](https://uiua.org/docs/match)'s glyph to avoid confusion with the new ocean functions' glyphs. Code using `‚âÖ` will continue to work and will be formatted as `‚âç`.
- Stack signatures found to be incorrect at runtime produce an error
- Dyadic math operations now work with [`under ‚çú`](https://uiua.org/docs/under) even if both arguments are outside [`under ‚çú`](https://uiua.org/docs/under)'s function
